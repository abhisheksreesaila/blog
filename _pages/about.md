This blog is a dumping ground for all my thoughts and learnings in the data, cloud & machine learning space.  Wherever possible I will try to explain the concepts intuitively either in words or a visual to help me understand (as well others reading)

Once in a while, I will throw in couple of life hacks I have learnt along the way such as mind maps, self-help books that made a difference in my life and might help you.
