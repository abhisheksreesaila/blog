I am Abhishek Sreesaila, certified Azure Cloud Solution Architect at EY, with a passion for data and machine learning. I am also a self-driving car enthusiast, built a self driving car during my spare time and using it to learn robotics. 

In the blog, you will find pratical tips on data, azure cloud, machine learning and robotics. Also, I will throw in couple of life hacks I have learnt along the way such as mind maps, clean code, self-help books that will possibly enrich your career and personal life. I play tennis and chess but not at a level that I can write about it :) You can reach me at this <a href="mailto:abhishek.sreesaila@gmail.com"> email address </a>
