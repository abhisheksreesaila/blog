What is RVIZ and how do i get it? . rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Here we need to visualize and track car&#39;s movements in your laptop computer. So you have to set the variables correctly so that CAR can send the messages to your computer and vice-versa. . FAQs . 1. Why can&#39;t I open RVIZ directly by SSH-ing to car? In other words, why do i need laptop computer to open up RVIZ? RVIZ does not support X11 windows, and hence ssh -X will not work . 2. I have a mac/windows. How do I use RVIZ? Download the virtual machine image that already has the MuSHR stack and follow instructions here (highly recommended) . Set the ROS IP&#39;s Variables . The setup is best shown visually below . . Instructions . 1) Open .bashrc and set the variables. This will make sure we dont have to do this everytime you open a command shell. (trust me, you have to open a ton of times for testing) . sudo nano ~/.bashrc . Go to the last line of the script and add the following lines. Depending on whether you are setting the variables in the car or your laptop, set the IP ADDRESS accordingly. . export ROS_IP= &lt;&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;IP ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . For those wondering how to get the IP ADDRESS . # To get the ip address ifconfig . Maps . For any car to drive, we need maps so that car can understanding the boundaries and navigate accordingly. . Create a map of your surrounding . Use GMAPPING Library . Start each one of following commands in a separate window as suggested here . # Start teleop (1st window) roslaunch mushr_base teleop.launch # Start gmapping scan (2nd window). MUSHR with a LIDAR publishes on the &quot;base_scan&quot; topic rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=scan . Drive around the house or park or whereever. . Tips for producing a good map . Drive slowly. | Drive around the same place couple times | Finish a loop | . We can save the built map using the following command. This command will listen to the map topic and save into the image. The map server package does this operation . rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap . The map generated will be clumsy at times. . . But, we can correct it using any photo editing software. After using GIMP it was modified to . .

Move it to appropriate folder later #upload from local desktop to car scp ~/Desktop/real-floor0.pgm robot@&lt;&lt;CAR IP&gt;&gt;:~ . Edit CONFIG files to use the map . Navigate to MUSHR BASE maps directory and place your maps. Note that you need both the PGM and YAML file. . Note: Make sure the YAML file is referring the correct PGM file . roscd mushr_base cd maps #copy pgm files to the current directory (mushr_base/maps) cp &quot;pgm files from whichever directory you have them&quot; . . Now, change the launch files . #go 1 level higher. Current directory assumed (mushr_base/maps) cd .. cd launch cd includes #edit launch files. see screenshot nano map_server.launch . . Battery . Battery is one of the most important elements in a self driving car. If the JETSON NANO is not powered long enough, you cannot TEST, DEBUG the car. I tried the NIiMH batteries suggested by the MUSHR team, but due to lmited battery knowledge ended up draining them and hence making it unusable!! So after thorough research, I ended buying LIPO BATTERY pack here and battery charger here . Warning: DO NOT IGNORE THIS SECTION. Having a good battery and taking good care of will save you ton of time downstream when you are stuck in code debugging or testing on track. . FAQs . Why LIPOS Battery (instead of NiMH)? . The advantages of lithium batteries compared to NiMH batteries are undeniable. The weight/power ratio in LiPo batteries is significantly better. LiPo batteries are noticeably lighter and they can store the same amount or more energy relative to their capacity than NiMH batteries. Also, . It costs the same as NiMH | Using a smart battery charger, control the charge and use it for years!! | . Ok, I agree LIPOS are good. What the hell is BALANCE CHARGE vs FAST CHARGE vs SLOW CHARGE vs STORAGE CHARGE? Which one do I use? . BALANCE CHARGE Charges both the cells inside the battery equally. Use this setting 99.99% of the time. . | STORAGE CHARGE Charges the cells in such a way so that you can store them for months (and hence the name). LIPOS if they are allowed to drain, will drain completely and not work this requiring them to jump start. . | FAST and SLOW CHARGE Charges fast and slow as name suggest. Used in certain special cases. . | . Ok, basic question, How do I connect and charge? . . . Do I ever going to need buy NiMH Batteries in the HARDWARE list section ? No . References .

This can also serve as a reference for general Azure questions as well (not necessarily for exam). I have provided them in image and PDF. Choose which ever suits your need. . Why MindMap? . While traditional list-based note taking works, mind map takes this to the next level by adding color, images and free flow format that is absent in lists. This has helped me refer the material easily since i can glance all-at-once quickly, or go to a section without hunting and pecking.

When you install the stock image of JETSON NANO using BelenaEtcher, connect JETSON NANO using HDMI, NAno boots and you can see the Linux GUI. But, if you do the same exact same thing using MUSHR IMAGE, it does not show the GUI. Without the GUI, software config is almost impossible. Well, almost. There is a &quot;command line&quot; solution provided as well for all the geeks out there. . Solution 1 . USE DISPLAY PORT . Important: If you have a monitor that supports DISPLAY PORT, use it!! Instant solution. (Time saving : 3-4 days). You can buy the display port from the link below. . DISPLAY PORT to DISPLAY PORT cable | . If you only have HDMI port, read on . Solution 2 . USE COMMAND LINE . STEP 1: SSH . You need to LOGIN (using SSH). For SSH, you need WIFI, For WIFI you need to LOGIN. Get it! chicken-egg problem? Almost. There is one possible solution, Hard-wired USB connection . Connect the MICRO USB port of NANO to the USB PORT of your laptop (also known as HEADLESS LOGIN) | . HEADLESS LOGIN (on a Mac) . #Go to dev directory cd /dev #check for all things like tty and usb ls *tty*usb* tty.usbmodem146123 # result (yours might be slightly different) #use the screen command with the result of previous step + serial interface number screen tty.usbmodem146123 115200 # 115200 is the Jetson serial interface. &quot;screen&quot; is installed on a mac by default # (It will ask for SUDO login and password) . .

STEP 2: GPARTED, BLUETOOTH, IP ADDRESS FIX . Before installing anything, there seems to be some sort of lock on the &quot;linux&quot; installer to donwload. For eg. . E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock – open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it? . Here is the fix : . sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock . GPARTED . sudo apt-get install gparted gparted # opens up the GUI as shown below. Now, follow instructions from the MUSHR site. . . . BLUETOOTH . hcitool dev . If the Bluetooth adapter is working and available, you should see its address listed (each address is unique): . Devices: hci0 38:##:##:##:##:## . bluetoothctl #opens up a bluetooth prompt agent on scan on # scan near by bluetooth devices. Start your PS4 controller scan off # Switch it off after getting the MAC ADDRESS of the wireless controller trust MAC_ADDRESS # trust, pair and connect pair MAC_ADDRRESS connect MAC_ADDRESS . . After connecting to the bluetooth, we should test it. . sudo apt-get install -y jstest-gtk # install the jstest package jstest-gtk #run this. It will open up GUI as follows . . IP ADDRESS FIX . ROS IP and MASTER URI will not be set to your IP automatically. USe this commands below in the local bashrc file so that it is set everytime you login (vs you typing these commands everytime) . export ROS_IP=&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . . BLDC Tool . . Important: Now, this step can only be done when you finish the Hardware configuration since you need the VESC connected to JETSON NANO + MOTOR to test it properly. . cd &amp;&amp; ./bldc-tool/BLDC_Tool . Version Problem . If you have ordered Flipsky VESC, chances are that you will have 3.X firmware installed (The hardware version is 410/411/412, but the firmware version is different). . Warning: BLDC tool can only support 2.18 (and hence MUSHR car). This wil throw an SERIAL PORT ERROR and will NOT connect to BLDC TOOL GUI. BLDC is old tool and is replaced by VESC TOOL . Solution . Download the VESC TOOL from the website and it will let you connect easily. | It will ask you to install the latest software.DO NOT install latest. | Use &quot;custom&quot; firmware (follow this link). The custom firmware is nothing but the BLDC servoout.bin file that is installed via BLDC tool. (also available here) | Now, open the BLDC tool and hit &quot;connect&quot; and it will be successful. | Follow the instructions from the MUSHR Software Setup i.e load the sensorless xml config file and &quot;write&quot; it back to VESC | . Note: If VESC tool is a newer version of the BLDC tool, why is heck do we need BLDC tool? MUSHR parameters has been set to BLDC tool and works only when you use it. . Note: Everything spinning in the right direction?? In the BLDC tool, Push the &quot;top&quot; arrow key and the wheels should move forward, and vice versa, if it moves in the reverse direction, it means the &quot;wires&quot; from the VESC to the motor has been criss crossed. Reverse the wire connection and you should be good. See below for visual. I personally used VESC tool to check it. . References . wiki.archlinux | bbs.archlinux.org | linuxcommando | desertbot | .",

They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. . Background . My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted MUSHR website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step.

In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is&quot; . Over the next few sections, I will report all the issue I faced and my attemps to fix it. Someone of them are major issues and some minor, but nevertheless you need to overcome them in order to proceed. . Acquiring the parts . All the materials needed for the projects and outlined here It even provides links to various websites to order parts. . . Tip 1 : Order the 3D parts first . . Important: There are 3D printed parts needed to complete the assembly. Might add &quot;weeks&quot; to your project if taken lightly. Order the 3D parts here . Ordering the 3D printed parts is tricky. The local library will be cheap but will take weeks before they complete. On the other hand, there are industries who can finish in 2 days, but will charge ~400-500 bucks. After a lot of research I found 3DHUBS. They are fast (3-4 day shippng time) and cheaper than most of them I could find on the internet. . They need your offical/school email ID (not personal gmail/outlook) | Choose Standard PLA (FDM) This is the cheapest material. | DO NOT order racecar_cover_number, racecar_cover_text and racecar_cover_image It&#39;s not needed to build the assembly and will save you about $30-40. Moreover, 3dhubs will report these as errors which are tough to fix (not a good use of your time) . Important: By the way it will cost you around ~$175 | . Tip 2 : Order Tools and Accessories . Apart from ordering parts from https://mushr.io/hardware/build_instructions/ there are extra tools needed which are assumed to be present in every household. Make sure you order the following parts also. . Screw Driver Set (115 in 1 Magnetic Screwdriver) You need screw driver bits of various shapes and sizes to finish the project, so do not assume your 1/2 favorite screw driver will work in this case | Crimping tool | HandGun | Soldering Kit | HXT 4mm Bullet to Male T-Plug Connector | . Optional Tools . Important: Applicable to only MACBOOK and USBC-only windows laptop. Find similar products to suit your laptop configuration. . MEMORY CARD reader | . Tip 3 : Order REDCAT with Brushless Motor installed . In the instructions manual, there are 2 options for provided for the Redcat Racing Blackout. . Choose the one with BRUSHLESS MOTOR | DO NOT ORDER &quot;Sensorless Brushless Motor&quot; (saves $30) | . Tip 4 : Picking the right VESC . This is the order of recommendation. . Turnigy version (Recommended. No soldering required) . | Flipsky version (I ordered this due to &quot;out of stock&quot; on other items) . | MayTech version . | . Tip 5 : Misc Tips .
