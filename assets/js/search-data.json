Scenarios . Monitor not booting up, after MUSHR image is installed. How do i proceed? . Issue . When you install the stock image of JETSON NANO using BelenaEtcher, connect JETSON NANO using HDMI, NAno boots and you can see the Linux GUI. But, if you do the same exact same thing using MUSHR IMAGE, it does not show the GUI. without the GUI, software config is almost impossible (well, I am not referring to LINUX gurus here, everything possible from a GUI is also possible with command line in LINUX). In other words, we need the GUI working. . Solution . Important: If you have a monitor that supports DISPLAY PORT, use it!! Instant solution. (Time saving : 3-4 days) If you only have HDMI port, read on. . To troubleshoot the issue, . You need to LOGIN (using SSH). For SSH, you need WIFI, For WIFI you need to LOGIN.

            "content": "Purpose . To build a low cost self driving car inspired from the paper MuSHR: A Low-Cost, Open-Source Robotic Racecar for Education and Research. They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. . Background . My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted MUSHR website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step. Additionally, they report in their website that its &quot;Classroom-tested&quot; which i wanted to hear. So i decided to jump-in with blind faith that it will be worth my time. . The Missing Manual . MUSHR team have excellent documentation which helps anyone understand and build a self driving car. But there is a saying . In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is&quot; . Over the next few sections, I will report all the issue I faced and my attemps to fix it. Someone of them are major issues and some super silly, but nevertheless you need to ovecome them in order to proceed. . Acquiring the parts .

Important: There are 3D printed parts needed to complete the assembly. Might add &quot;weeks&quot; to your project if taken lightly. Order thre 3D parts available here . Ordering the 3D printed parts is tricky. The local library will be cheap but will take weeks before they complete. On the other hand, there are industries who can finish in 2 days, but will charge ~400-500 bucks. After a lot of research I found 3DHUBS. They are fast (3-4 day shippng time) and cheaper than most of them I could find on the internet. . They need your offical/school email ID (not personal gmail/outlook) | Choose Standard PLA (FDM) This is the cheapest material. | DO NOT order racecar_cover_number.stl, racecar_cover_text.stl, racecar_cover_image.stl It&#39;s not needed to build the assembly and will save you about $30-40. Moreover, 3dhubs will report these as errors which are tough to fix (not a good use of your time) . Important: By the way it will cost you around ~$175 | . Tip 2 : Order Tools and Accessories . Apart from ordering parts from https://mushr.io/hardware/build_instructions/ there are extra tools needed which are assumed to be present in every household. Make sure you order the following parts also. . Screw Driver Set (115 in 1 Magnetic Screwdriver) You need screw driver bits of various shapes and sizes to finish the project, so do not assume your 1/2 favorite screw driver will work in this case | Crimping tool | HandGun | Soldering Kit | HXT 4mm Bullet to Male T-Plug Connector | . Optional Tools . Important: Applicable to only MACBOOK and USBC-only windows laptop. Find similar products to suit your laptop configuration. . MEMORY CARD reader | DISPLAY PORT Cable | .
