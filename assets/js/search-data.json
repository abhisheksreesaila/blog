I will highlight the sections that I ran into problems and solutions for them. . Servo Motor Install Tips . During the installation of the SERVO MOTOR, You need to remove the hex screws. BUT the hex screws are tough to remove and might end up messing up the screw head. This damage can be permananent and will prevent from removing the existing SERVO MOTOR! In other words, the screws will SCREW you! and it did in my case. See below. To counter that, I had to remove the TOP parts (melt them, crack them etc.) and naturally the screws will open up at the bottom. This will take few hours to complete, since the screw heads was damaged there was any other way to remove screws. . . . . . Weak 3D Printing Parts . There could be 3D printing parts that are weak and break. No issues, just use the glue and put them back! . . . . Buck Converter Steps . If you have a connector different than the MUSHR videos, then you might need to connect as shows to configure the buck converter . . . . Push Button Install Tip . Use the threads instead of screws. The screws didnt fit well to the back of the push button . . . . . Camera Install Screw Alternative . This screw is provided as a part of BUCK CONVERTER . . . Lower Platform Imperfections . 3D Imperfections are OK . . . . . Upper Platform Trick . Stick a tape to the nut and them remove it. This is useful to screws on the backside of the platform which might fall off. . . . . . Final Door Trick . If you screw the final door, then you need to remove it again for charging the batteries (which is more often than you think). To solve the issue, use the VELCRO as shown . . .

Scenarios . Monitor not booting up, after MUSHR image is installed. How do i proceed? . Issue . When you install the stock image of JETSON NANO using BelenaEtcher, connect JETSON NANO using HDMI, NAno boots and you can see the Linux GUI. But, if you do the same exact same thing using MUSHR IMAGE, it does not show the GUI. without the GUI, software config is almost impossible (well, I am not referring to LINUX gurus here, everything possible from a GUI is also possible with command line in LINUX). In other words, we need the GUI working. . Solution 1 . USE DISPLAY PORT . Important: If you have a monitor that supports DISPLAY PORT, use it!! Instant solution. (Time saving : 3-4 days) If you only have HDMI port, read on. . Solution 2 . *USE COMMAND LINE . STEP 1: SSH . You need to LOGIN (using SSH). For SSH, you need WIFI, For WIFI you need to LOGIN. Get it! chicken-egg problem? Almost. There is one possible solution, Hard-wired USB connection . Connect the MICRO USB port of NANO to the USB PORT of your laptop (also known as HEADLESS LOGIN) | . HEADLESS LOGIN (on a Mac) . #Go to dev directory cd /dev #check for all things like tty and usb ls *tty*usb* tty.usbmodem146123 # result (yours might be slightly different) #use the screen command with the result of previous step + serial interface number screen tty.usbmodem146123 115200 # 115200 is the Jetson serial interface. &quot;screen&quot; is installed on a mac by default # (It will ask for SUDO login and password) . . ACTIVATE THE ROOT in JETSON NANO . Be aware that the root account is not active by default. You will need to do: . sudo passwd root . Then go ahead to set password. Use the root user using . su root . USE WPA_SUPPLICANT TO CONNECT .

Needed to connect to SSH. Uff, finally! . **Connect to the JETSON NANO . Open a terminal window . ssh -X robot@IP_ADDRESS #enter your IP address (Notice -X) . STEP 2: GPARTED, BLDC, BLUETOOTH, IP ADDRESS FIX . Before installing anything, there seems to be some sort of lock on the &quot;linux&quot; installer to donwload. For eg. . E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock – open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it? . Here is the fix : . sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock . GPARTED . sudo apt-get install gparted gparted # opens up the GUI as shown below. Now, follow instructions from the MUSHR site. . . . BLUETOOTH . https://desertbot.io/blog/how-to-add-a-dual-wifi-bluetooth-card-to-a-jetson-nano-intel-8265 . hcitool dev . If the Bluetooth adapter is working and available, you should see its address listed (each address is unique): . Devices: hci0 38:##:##:##:##:## . bluetoothctl #opens up a bluetooth prompt agent on scan on # scan near by bluetooth devices. Start your PS4 controller scan off # Switch it off after getting the MAC ADDRESS of the wireless controller trust MAC_ADDRESS # trust, pair and connect pair MAC_ADDRRESS connect MAC_ADDRESS . . After connecting to the bluetooth, we should test it. . sudo apt-get install -y jstest-gtk # install the jstest package jstest-gtk #run this. It will open up GUI as follows . . IP ADDRESS FIX . ROS IP and MASTER URI will not be set to your IP automatically. USe this commands below in the local bashrc file so that it is set everytime you login (vs you typing these commands everytime) . export ROS_IP=&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . . BLDC Tool . Important: Now, this step can only be done when you finish the Hardware configuration since you need the VESC connected to JETSON NANO + MOTOR to test it properly. . cd &amp;&amp; ./bldc-tool/BLDC_Tool . If you have ordered Flipsky VESC, chances are that you will have 3.X firmware installed (The hardware version is 410/411/412, but the firmware version is different). The problem is that BLDC tool can only support 2.18 (and hence MUSHR car too!). This wil throw an SERIAL PORT ERROR and will not connect to BLDC TOOL GUI. BLDC is old tool and is replaced by VESC TOOL . Download the VESC TOOL from the website and it will let you connect easily. | It will ask you to install the latest software.DO NOT install latest. | Use &quot;custom&quot; firmware (follow this link). The custom firmware is nothing but the BLDC servoout.bin file that is installed via BLDC tool. (also available here) | . . . Now, open the BLDC tool and hit &quot;connect&quot; and it will be successful. Now IF VESC tool is a newer version of the BLDC tool, why is heck do we need BLDC tool? MUSHR parameters has been set to BLDC tool and works only when you use it. After your gain mastery over the MUSHR software you can try VESC tool. . | Follow the instructions from the MUSHR.IO website i.e load the sensorless xml config file and &quot;write&quot; it back to VESC . | Push the &quot;top&quot; arrow key and the wheels should move forward, and vice versa, if its moves in the reverse direction, it means the &quot;wires&quot; from the VESC to the motor has been criss crossed. reverse the wire connection and you should be good.

            "content": "Purpose . To build a low cost self driving car inspired from the paper MuSHR: A Low-Cost, Open-Source Robotic Racecar for Education and Research. They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. . Background . My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted MUSHR website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step. Additionally, they report in their website that its &quot;Classroom-tested&quot; which i wanted to hear. So i decided to jump-in with blind faith that it will be worth my time. . The Missing Manual . MUSHR team have excellent documentation which helps anyone understand and build a self driving car. But there is a saying . In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is&quot; . Over the next few sections, I will report all the issue I faced and my attemps to fix it. Someone of them are major issues and some super silly, but nevertheless you need to ovecome them in order to proceed. . Acquiring the parts . All the materials needed for the projects and outlined here It even provides links to various websites to order parts. . . Tip 1 : Order the 3D parts first . . Important: There are 3D printed parts needed to complete the assembly. Might add &quot;weeks&quot; to your project if taken lightly. Order thre 3D parts available here . Ordering the 3D printed parts is tricky. The local library will be cheap but will take weeks before they complete. On the other hand, there are industries who can finish in 2 days, but will charge ~400-500 bucks. After a lot of research I found 3DHUBS. They are fast (3-4 day shippng time) and cheaper than most of them I could find on the internet. . They need your offical/school email ID (not personal gmail/outlook) | Choose Standard PLA (FDM) This is the cheapest material. | DO NOT order racecar_cover_number.stl, racecar_cover_text.stl, racecar_cover_image.stl It&#39;s not needed to build the assembly and will save you about $30-40. Moreover, 3dhubs will report these as errors which are tough to fix (not a good use of your time) . Important: By the way it will cost you around ~$175 | . Tip 2 : Order Tools and Accessories . Apart from ordering parts from https://mushr.io/hardware/build_instructions/ there are extra tools needed which are assumed to be present in every household. Make sure you order the following parts also. . Screw Driver Set (115 in 1 Magnetic Screwdriver) You need screw driver bits of various shapes and sizes to finish the project, so do not assume your 1/2 favorite screw driver will work in this case | Crimping tool | HandGun | Soldering Kit | HXT 4mm Bullet to Male T-Plug Connector | . Optional Tools . Important: Applicable to only MACBOOK and USBC-only windows laptop. Find similar products to suit your laptop configuration. . MEMORY CARD reader | DISPLAY PORT Cable | . Tip 3 : Order REDCAT with Brushless Motor installed . In the instructions manual, there are 2 options for provided for the Redcat Racing Blackout. . Choose the one with BRUSHLESS MOTOR | DO NOT ORDER &quot;Sensorless Brushless Motor&quot; (saves $30) | . Tip 4 : Picking the right VESC . This is the order of recommendation. . Turnigy version (Recommended. No soldering required) . | Flipsky version (I ordered this due to &quot;out of stock&quot; on other items) . | MayTech version . | . Tip 5 : Misc Tips . Intel RealSense T265 is not needed for your first version of the car. You can add later if you choose to. | Solderless Wire Connector from the instructions is currently unavailable.
