            "content": "Padding in CNNs . Why use padding? In addition to the aforementioned benefit of keeping the spatial sizes constant after CONV, doing this actually improves performance. If the CONV layers were to not zero-pad the inputs and only perform valid convolutions, then the size of the volumes would reduce by a small amount after each CONV, and the information at the borders would be “washed away” too quickly . Reference . Linear vs Logistic Regression . In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values. | .

In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. Logistic Regression is used when response variable is categorical in nature | . If, instead, you wanted to predict, based on size, whether a house would sell for more than 200K, you would use logistic regression. The possible outputs are either Yes, the house will sell for more than 200K, or No, the house will not . What is data augmentation? . Overfitting is caused by having too few samples to learn from, rendering us unable to train a model able to generalize to new data. Given infinite data, our model would be exposed to every possible aspect of the data distribution at hand: we would never overfit. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more training data from existing training samples, by &quot;augmenting&quot; the samples via a number of random transformations that yield believable-looking images. The goal is that at training time, our model would never see the exact same picture twice. This helps the model get exposed to more aspects of the data and generalize better. . What is Momentum? . Momentum helps to speed the optimization process toward the minimum of the loss and get out of saddle points by adding a running average of previous gradients and use that average instead of the current batch of data. It forces the gradient descent toward the correct direction to the loss by making the convergence faster and by reducing oscillations . What is learning rate? . The learning rate is how quickly or how slowly a network updates old parameters for new ones. By default, the learning rate is held constant, however, this way may cause some issues such as: • If the learning rate is too small, it will take a long time to reach the optimum, or maybe never reach it. • If the learning rate is too big, it will keep bouncing around the optimum. The optimization method may get stuck in shallow valleys! . What are auto-encoders? . Autoencoders are a specific type of feedforward neural networks where the input is the same as the output. They compress the input into a lower-dimensional code and then reconstruct the output from this representation. The code is a compact “summary” or “compression” of the input, also called the latent-space representation. An autoencoder consists of 3 components: encoder, code and decoder. The encoder compresses the input and produces the code, the decoder then reconstructs the input only using this code. . . To build an autoencoder we need 3 things: an encoding method, decoding method, and a loss function to compare the output with the target. Autoencoders are mainly a dimensionality reduction (or compression) algorithm with a couple of important properties . Data specific | Lossy | Unsupervised | . Why batches in training ml model? . Ideally, we&#39;d like to use all our data for every step of training because that would give us a better sense of what we should be doing, but that&#39;s expensive. So, instead, we use a different subset every time. Doing this is cheap and has much of the same benefit. . . CNN . . . Extra Read . https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/ .

            "content": "Kalman Filter Intuition . PURPOSE . Kalman Filter are useful tools to measure something that cannot be measured directly! You gather all the attributes to measure it indirectly. Example : you cannot measure the moving vehicle position w.r.t to its surroundings, so use LIDAR to throw light at them and measure the reflections back to create a map of the objects around it. Its not going to be perfect, but its a good approx. Another example is SONAR - Measure the speed of sound reflection to measure ocean&#39;s depth. . Kalman filter has the these high level components:- . PREDICTION - Predict the next state of the object. | MEASUREMENT - Measure the current state of the object. | CONFIDENCE - How good (or bad) the PREDICTED or MEASUREMENT values are | . Kalman filter (or variants) have the following intuition. . CURRENT STATE . Suppose current time is 3:00pm | . PREDICTION over MEASUREMENT . After few mins, we look at the watch again and we PREDICT its 3:04pm, but its shows 3:55pm!! | We know the MEASUREMENT is wrong and have every reason to believe the PREDICTION is more acccurate and set the watch to be 3:04pm. Our CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT is shaken, we believe it is so noisy to show 3:55pm | . MEASUREMENT over PREDICTION . On the other hand, if the measurement shows 3:05 pm, we have greater confidence that MEASUREMENT is correct, since its more or less in line with our expectations and since its actually measured, thats should be more accurate. Here we trust or more CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT. | . Limitations . Kalman filters assumes the measurements and noise to have an gaussian distrbution. Does not suport multi-modal? . Path Planning . Djikistra algorithm . Assumptions . We have a map | We know the starting location and ending location | We know the cost to reach any node in the map i.e we have a weighted graph | . | Algorithm . Start at the source node.

It will give the shortest node from any node to all other nodes provided they are reachable from source. . As always, lets look at it visually! . Assume the cost between each cell is 1. . Visit each cell until you reach the TARGET node . . Working of A# (subset of Djikistra) . Uses the heuristic appraoch combined the elements of Djikistra use g_cost = distance from start node | . | keep track of the directions the goal use h_cost = distance towards the goal this could be &quot;euclidiean distnace (shortest distance between 2 points in space) (with or without collision) | Manhattan distance = grid distance between 2 points in space (avoiding collisions) | . | . | optimal distance In each iteration, always select the node with the lowest f_cost = sum(g_cost, h_cost) | . | .

Use random probabilities to determine | Completely differet a* and djikstras algo | algorithm From the start position, generate random point | if its too far, reduce to max allowable threshold | connect the point to its nearest node. if you starting out it will be the root node, but subsquently there could other closer points | while connecting, if there is a collision, then ignore the point, then repeat | keep doing this until you generate a point close to the goal (closeness distance set by you) | . | .

For example, if the activation map is 512 x 7 x 7, then then the number of graidents are also 512 x 7 x 7 . Why averaging gradients yields weights? | . CAM uses WEIGHTS at the Fully Connected layer to choose the &quot;feature maps&quot; that is more relevant and squash the ones which are not. So it is highly dependent of (CONV Layer =&gt; Global Average Pooling Layer ==&gt; FC Layer) network. GRAD-CAM uses this concept by make its more general. It uses GRADIENTS to provide the weights. We use the GRADIENTS in the last conv layer, do the global average pooling ourselves, and now we have our weights! we dont have to depend on specific GAP layer nor the weights of the fully connected layer. GRADIENTS provide a good enough &quot;weighting mechanism&quot; to pick the feature map that is relevant and squash the one which we dont.

But people tend to start big even if they think its small. | The book talks about how a person wanting to get to GYM, started going to GYM, stay for 5 mins and come back home, for 4 weeks. | Eventually he developed a habit to go to GYM and become better. The principle is &quot;Standardize, then optimize&quot; | The book recommends the 2 minute rule : The first version of the should be so small that it can be started and completed within 2 minutes. (just like the line i am typing right now**) | . It&#39;s ok to miss a day. but not 2. . Often we going to strict routine and follow them to the tee, and after a day of disruption, give up telling ourselves that its worthless. | Missing 1 day is OK, dont miss 2 in a row. | Getting back in line is still waaaaaay better than giving up all the way. | . Connecting developing one to an already developed habit . If you want to floss, keep next to the tooth brush | . Remove friction towards good ones. . If you are going to GYM, then think of the smallest of things like direction of driving, getting water, clothes in your closet etc. because each one of them are contributing to your resistance. When you remove them or smoothen them out, it will easy not to miss GYM and before you know you are on your way!! | . Increase friction towards bad ones . Just place your remote in the other room and you wont watch hours of TV. | Just remove favorites in your browser and you wont watch youtube | Just move the junk good to a upper shelf, you will stop eating junk | Place the phone in the other room, you will stop addicted to your phone | . Avoiding Procastination . We always value present than future. unless the present is rewarding we wont start. we will look to the dream of achieving instead of hard work. Make the present rewarding, pleasant. . Break the future goal into different steps. | Ask yourself how you can enjoy the present. Series of such experiences should be connected to a goal you are seeking. | GOAL : Getting fit is the goal, but going to GYM is bad soln 1: Go to Gym and then you can get watch netflix for 30 mins soln 2 : Better, go to treadmill and watch netflix in the gym | . Develop an identity based habit . When we develop a habit, the best way to stick to it is cultivate an identity around it. For example, the goal is not be read 100 books, but the goal should be phrased to be say &quot;the goal is to become a READER&quot;. the goal is not to run a marathon, but become a RUNNER&quot;. . Habit : Daily GITHUB check-ins. lot of work today. so added a 2 min rule (which took 2 mins to complete) . Habits can get boring . When we develop a new habit, pretty soon the novelty dies and we can slip into complancency. Most habits we seek and develop require constant improvement. Instead of aiming to drastic improvements and giving up, we should seek organic small improvements. In others words, aim for constant, small enough to make improvements with little effort and but LARGE enough to feel satisified At first, it can become a trial-and-error but you can reach local optimum pretty quickly and continue the effort OR else you will give up the habits you started with. For eg. workouts. . Boredom (not failure) is impediment to success. Professionals stick to schedule while amateurs lets life &quot;get in the way&quot; . Importance of Genes in building habits .

What is RVIZ and how do i get it? . rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Here we need to visualize and track car&#39;s movements in your laptop computer. So you have to set the variables correctly so that CAR can send the messages to your computer and vice-versa. . FAQs . 1. Why can&#39;t I open RVIZ directly by SSH-ing to car? In other words, why do i need laptop computer to open up RVIZ? RVIZ does not support X11 windows, and hence ssh -X will not work . 2. I have a mac/windows. How do I use RVIZ? Download the virtual machine image that already has the MuSHR stack and follow instructions here (highly recommended) . Set the ROS IP&#39;s Variables . The setup is best shown visually below . . Instructions . 1) Open .bashrc and set the variables. This will make sure we dont have to do this everytime you open a command shell. (trust me, you have to open a ton of times for testing) . sudo nano ~/.bashrc . Go to the last line of the script and add the following lines. Depending on whether you are setting the variables in the car or your laptop, set the IP ADDRESS accordingly. . export ROS_IP= &lt;&lt;LAPTOP_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;CAR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . For those wondering how to get the IP ADDRESS . # To get the ip address ifconfig . LAPTOP IP Address will be dynamic by default and might be pain to enter each time you login. You can use the following script to extract &quot;IP Address&quot; from the configuration. . . enp0s17 = wireless interface that shows the IP address . laptop-ip-address . ifconfig enp0s17 | grep &quot;inet&quot; | awk &#39;NR==1{print $2}&#39; . . Important: NETWORK SETTING on the ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX Make sure the NETWORK SETTING on the ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX used to load MUSHR SIM (linux image) has &quot;Bridge Adapter&quot; (NAT is default. NAT will NOT work. It will translate the IP from the CAR to SIM and hence wont read any messages) . . Maps . For any car to drive, we need maps so that car can understanding the boundaries and navigate accordingly. . Create a map of your surrounding . Use GMAPPING Library . Start each one of following commands in a separate window as suggested here . # Start teleop (1st window) roslaunch mushr_base teleop.launch # Start gmapping scan (2nd window). MUSHR with a LIDAR publishes on the &quot;base_scan&quot; topic rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=scan . Drive around the house or park or whereever. . Tips for producing a good map . Drive slowly. | Drive around the same place couple times | Finish a loop | . We can save the built map using the following command. This command will listen to the map topic and save into the image. The map server package does this operation . rosrun map_server map_saver -f real-floor0 . The map generated will be clumsy at times. . . But, we can correct it using any photo editing software. After using GIMP it was modified to . . Note: You might to download the file to your local desktop, Open in GIMP/Photoshop to edit the software. . #download to local desktop scp robot@&lt;&lt;CAR IP&gt;&gt;:~/real-floor0.pgm ~/Desktop/ . #note that this uploads to home folder. Move it to appropriate folder later #upload from local desktop to car scp ~/Desktop/real-floor0.pgm robot@&lt;&lt;CAR IP&gt;&gt;:~ . CROP Map . By default the map contains an abundance of blank space around the area of detected surfaces By default the file will be 16MB, which will slow down the HALTON SAMPLER when you load the maps and run your car. So we need to crop unnecessary part of the image. But care has to be taken not to blindly crop and lose the origin. For this purpose there is an undocumented utility CROP_MAP to crop the map, removing the blank spaces around the map.In my case, it reduced by 20x. . . Edit CONFIG files to use the map . Navigate to MUSHR RHC maps directory and place your maps. Note that you need both the PGM and YAML file. . Note: Make sure the YAML file is referring the correct PGM file . roscd mushr_rhc_ros cd maps #copy pgm files to the current directory (mushr_base/maps) cp &quot;pgm files from whichever directory you have them&quot; . . Now, change the launch files . #go 1 level higher. Current directory assumed (mushr_base/maps) cd .. cd launch #edit launch files. see screenshot nano map_server.launch . . Battery . Battery is one of the most important elements in a self driving car. If the JETSON NANO is not powered long enough, you cannot TEST, DEBUG the car. I tried the NIiMH batteries suggested by the MUSHR team, but due to lmited battery knowledge ended up draining them and hence making it unusable!! So after thorough research, I ended buying LIPO BATTERY pack here and battery charger here . Warning: DO NOT IGNORE THIS SECTION. Having a good battery and taking good care of will save you ton of time downstream when you are stuck in code debugging or testing on track. . FAQs . Why LIPOS Battery (instead of NiMH)? . The advantages of lithium batteries compared to NiMH batteries are undeniable. The weight/power ratio in LiPo batteries is significantly better. LiPo batteries are noticeably lighter and they can store the same amount or more energy relative to their capacity than NiMH batteries. Also, . It costs the same as NiMH | Using a smart battery charger, control the charge and use it for years!! | . Ok, I agree LIPOS are good. What the hell is BALANCE CHARGE vs FAST CHARGE vs SLOW CHARGE vs STORAGE CHARGE? Which one do I use? . BALANCE CHARGE Charges both the cells inside the battery equally. Use this setting 99.99% of the time. . | STORAGE CHARGE Charges the cells in such a way so that you can store them for months (and hence the name). LIPOS if they are allowed to drain, will drain completely and not work this requiring them to jump start. . | FAST and SLOW CHARGE Charges fast and slow as name suggest. Used in certain special cases. . | . Ok, basic question, How do I connect and charge? . . . Do I ever going to need buy NiMH Batteries in the HARDWARE list section ? No . Low Voltage - If you keep the lipo batteries unused too long, the voltage drains and results in an &quot;low voltage error&quot; when you charge them back in a battery . . Use the NiMh option and charge the LIPO battey. this acts as a booster and increases voltage rapidly. | Increase above 4A and keep it right around 5AImportant :After 5A, after you feel its stabliizies around 5A mark, UNPLUG, Dont get greedy.- charge LIPO using LIPO options as normal and now the LOW VOLTAGE message will be gone. . | . .

But, if you do the same exact same thing using MUSHR IMAGE, it does not show the GUI. Without the GUI, software config is almost impossible. Well, almost. There is a &quot;command line&quot; solution provided as well for all the geeks out there. . Solution 1 . USE DISPLAY PORT . Important: If you have a monitor that supports DISPLAY PORT, use it!! Instant solution. (Time saving : 3-4 days). You can buy the display port from the link below. . DISPLAY PORT to DISPLAY PORT cable | . If you only have HDMI port, read on . Solution 2 . USE COMMAND LINE . STEP 1: SSH . You need to LOGIN (using SSH). For SSH, you need WIFI, For WIFI you need to LOGIN. Get it! chicken-egg problem? Almost. There is one possible solution, Hard-wired USB connection . Connect the MICRO USB port of NANO to the USB PORT of your laptop (also known as HEADLESS LOGIN) | .

STEP 2: GPARTED, BLUETOOTH, IP ADDRESS FIX . Before installing anything, there seems to be some sort of lock on the &quot;linux&quot; installer to donwload. For eg. . E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock – open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it? . Here is the fix : . sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend . GPARTED . sudo apt-get install gparted gparted # opens up the GUI as shown below. Now, follow instructions from the MUSHR site. . . . BLUETOOTH . hcitool dev . If the Bluetooth adapter is working and available, you should see its address listed (each address is unique): . Devices: hci0 38:##:##:##:##:## . bluetoothctl #opens up a bluetooth prompt agent on scan on # scan near by bluetooth devices. Start your PS4 controller scan off # Switch it off after getting the MAC ADDRESS of the wireless controller trust MAC_ADDRESS # trust, pair and connect pair MAC_ADDRRESS connect MAC_ADDRESS . . After connecting to the bluetooth, we should test it. . sudo apt-get install -y jstest-gtk # install the jstest package jstest-gtk #run this. It will open up GUI as follows . . IP ADDRESS FIX . ROS IP and MASTER URI will not be set to your IP automatically. USe this commands below in the local bashrc file so that it is set everytime you login (vs you typing these commands everytime) . export ROS_IP=&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . . BLDC Tool . . Important: Now, this step can only be done when you finish the Hardware configuration since you need the VESC connected to JETSON NANO + MOTOR to test it properly. . cd &amp;&amp; ./bldc-tool/BLDC_Tool . Version Problem . If you have ordered Flipsky VESC, chances are that you will have 3.X firmware installed (The hardware version is 410/411/412, but the firmware version is different). . Warning: BLDC tool can only support 2.18 (and hence MUSHR car). This wil throw an SERIAL PORT ERROR and will NOT connect to BLDC TOOL GUI. BLDC is old tool and is replaced by VESC TOOL . Solution . Download the VESC TOOL from the website and it will let you connect easily. | It will ask you to install the latest software.DO NOT install latest. | Use &quot;custom&quot; firmware (follow this link). The custom firmware is nothing but the BLDC servoout.bin file that is installed via BLDC tool. (also available here) | Now, open the BLDC tool and hit &quot;connect&quot; and it will be successful. | Follow the instructions from the MUSHR Software Setup i.e load the sensorless xml config file and &quot;write&quot; it back to VESC | . Note: If VESC tool is a newer version of the BLDC tool, why is heck do we need BLDC tool? MUSHR parameters has been set to BLDC tool and works only when you use it. . Note: Everything spinning in the right direction?? In the BLDC tool, Push the &quot;top&quot; arrow key and the wheels should move forward, and vice versa, if it moves in the reverse direction, it means the &quot;wires&quot; from the VESC to the motor has been criss crossed. Reverse the wire connection and you should be good. See below for visual. I personally used VESC tool to check it. . References . wiki.archlinux | bbs.archlinux.org | linuxcommando | desertbot | .",

They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. . Background . My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted MUSHR website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step.
