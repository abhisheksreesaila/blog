            "content": "Kalman Filter Intuition . PURPOSE . Kalman Filter are useful tools to measure something that cannot be measured directly! You gather all the attributes to measure it indirectly. Example : you cannot measure the moving vehicle position w.r.t to its surroundings, so use LIDAR to throw light at them and measure the reflections back to create a map of the objects around it. Its not going to be perfect, but its a good approx. Another example is SONAR - Measure the speed of sound reflection to measure ocean&#39;s depth. . Kalman filter has the these high level components:- . PREDICTION - Predict the next state of the object. | MEASUREMENT - Measure the current state of the object. | CONFIDENCE - How good (or bad) the PREDICTED or MEASUREMENT values are | . Kalman filter (or variants) have the following intuition. . CURRENT STATE . Suppose current time is 3:00pm | . PREDICTION over MEASUREMENT . After few mins, we look at the watch again and we PREDICT its 3:04pm, but its shows 3:55pm!! | We know the MEASUREMENT is wrong and have every reason to believe the PREDICTION is more acccurate and set the watch to be 3:04pm. Our CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT is shaken, we believe it is so noisy to show 3:55pm | . MEASUREMENT over PREDICTION . On the other hand, if the measurement shows 3:05 pm, we have greater confidence that MEASUREMENT is correct, since its more or less in line with our expectations and since its actually measured, thats should be more accurate. Here we trust or more CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT. | . Limitations . Kalman filters assumes the measurements and noise to have an gaussian distrbution. Does not suport multi-modal? . Path Planning . Djikistra algorithm . Assumptions . We have a map | We know the starting location and ending location | We know the cost to reach any node in the map i.e we have a weighted graph | . | Algorithm . Start at the source node. We maintain a tracker variable for registering its cost from source. | Since its origin, it is 0 Add this to your path list | . | Find neighbouring nodes Update the tracker variable from &quot;infinity&quot; to the cost from (source -&gt; neighbouring node) | If the node is already reached, then update the value of tracker only if its lesser than earlier value. | The &quot;value&quot; calculated from the source node. | . | Stop, when you reach the destination node | . | .

The global max poolng layer unlike the other maxpool layers will squash all features into 1 linear vector.

In other words, you will have location of the image where the model is focused on. . | How does dot product help? . | . . Learns Features. Stores Weights . . Use those weights with the activations and figure which one to focus on, which one to omit. . Drawbacks . The architecture needs to have global max pooling layer.

Pros . over comes all the issues of vanilla CAM | works for any images tasks (classification, segmentation, vQA) | . Cons . cannot locate mulitple objects within the images. | . . Why gradients equal same size as activation maps? | . The gradient is calculated for each pixel in the feature map. For example, if the activation map is 512 x 7 x 7, then then the number of graidents are also 512 x 7 x 7 . Why averaging gradients yields weights? | . CAM uses WEIGHTS at the Fully Connected layer to choose the &quot;feature maps&quot; that is more relevant and squash the ones which are not. So it is highly dependent of (CONV Layer =&gt; Global Average Pooling Layer ==&gt; FC Layer) network. GRAD-CAM uses this concept by make its more general. It uses GRADIENTS to provide the weights. We use the GRADIENTS in the last conv layer, do the global average pooling ourselves, and now we have our weights! we dont have to depend on specific GAP layer nor the weights of the fully connected layer. GRADIENTS provide a good enough &quot;weighting mechanism&quot; to pick the feature map that is relevant and squash the one which we dont. .

What is RVIZ and how do i get it? . rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Here we need to visualize and track car&#39;s movements in your laptop computer. So you have to set the variables correctly so that CAR can send the messages to your computer and vice-versa. . FAQs . 1. Why can&#39;t I open RVIZ directly by SSH-ing to car? In other words, why do i need laptop computer to open up RVIZ? RVIZ does not support X11 windows, and hence ssh -X will not work . 2. I have a mac/windows. How do I use RVIZ? Download the virtual machine image that already has the MuSHR stack and follow instructions here (highly recommended) . Set the ROS IP&#39;s Variables . The setup is best shown visually below . . Instructions . 1) Open .bashrc and set the variables. This will make sure we dont have to do this everytime you open a command shell. (trust me, you have to open a ton of times for testing) . sudo nano ~/.bashrc . Go to the last line of the script and add the following lines. Depending on whether you are setting the variables in the car or your laptop, set the IP ADDRESS accordingly. . export ROS_IP= &lt;&lt;LAPTOP_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;CAR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . For those wondering how to get the IP ADDRESS . # To get the ip address ifconfig . LAPTOP IP Address will be dynamic by default and might be pain to enter each time you login.

Important: NETWORK SETTING on the ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX Make sure the NETWORK SETTING on the ORACLE VIRTUAL BOX used to load MUSHR SIM (linux image) has &quot;Bridge Adapter&quot; (NAT is default. NAT will NOT work. It will translate the IP from the CAR to SIM and hence wont read any messages) . . Maps . For any car to drive, we need maps so that car can understanding the boundaries and navigate accordingly. . Create a map of your surrounding . Use GMAPPING Library . Start each one of following commands in a separate window as suggested here . # Start teleop (1st window) roslaunch mushr_base teleop.launch # Start gmapping scan (2nd window). MUSHR with a LIDAR publishes on the &quot;base_scan&quot; topic rosrun gmapping slam_gmapping scan:=scan . Drive around the house or park or whereever. . Tips for producing a good map .

Move it to appropriate folder later #upload from local desktop to car scp ~/Desktop/real-floor0.pgm robot@&lt;&lt;CAR IP&gt;&gt;:~ . CROP Map . By default the map contains an abundance of blank space around the area of detected surfaces By default the file will be 16MB, which will slow down the HALTON SAMPLER when you load the maps and run your car. So we need to crop unnecessary part of the image. But care has to be taken not to blindly crop and lose the origin. For this purpose there is an undocumented utility CROP_MAP to crop the map, removing the blank spaces around the map.In my case, it reduced by 20x. . . Edit CONFIG files to use the map . Navigate to MUSHR RHC maps directory and place your maps. Note that you need both the PGM and YAML file. . Note: Make sure the YAML file is referring the correct PGM file . roscd mushr_rhc_ros cd maps #copy pgm files to the current directory (mushr_base/maps) cp &quot;pgm files from whichever directory you have them&quot; . . Now, change the launch files . #go 1 level higher. Current directory assumed (mushr_base/maps) cd .. cd launch #edit launch files. see screenshot nano map_server.launch . . Battery .

So after thorough research, I ended buying LIPO BATTERY pack here and battery charger here . Warning: DO NOT IGNORE THIS SECTION. Having a good battery and taking good care of will save you ton of time downstream when you are stuck in code debugging or testing on track. . FAQs . Why LIPOS Battery (instead of NiMH)? . The advantages of lithium batteries compared to NiMH batteries are undeniable. The weight/power ratio in LiPo batteries is significantly better. LiPo batteries are noticeably lighter and they can store the same amount or more energy relative to their capacity than NiMH batteries. Also, . It costs the same as NiMH | Using a smart battery charger, control the charge and use it for years!! | . Ok, I agree LIPOS are good. What the hell is BALANCE CHARGE vs FAST CHARGE vs SLOW CHARGE vs STORAGE CHARGE? Which one do I use? . BALANCE CHARGE Charges both the cells inside the battery equally. Use this setting 99.99% of the time. . | STORAGE CHARGE Charges the cells in such a way so that you can store them for months (and hence the name). LIPOS if they are allowed to drain, will drain completely and not work this requiring them to jump start. . | FAST and SLOW CHARGE Charges fast and slow as name suggest.

I will highlight the sections that I ran into problems and solutions for them. This is NOT a TUTORIAL rather a buffet of practical problems faced and solutions provided to overcome them easily. . . Servo Motor Install Tips . During the installation of the SERVO MOTOR, You need to remove the hex screws. BUT the hex screws are tough to remove and might end up messing up the screw head. This damage can be permananent and will prevent from removing the existing SERVO MOTOR! In other words, the screws will SCREW you! and it did in my case. See below. To counter that, I had to remove the TOP parts (melt them, crack them etc.) and naturally the screws will open up at the bottom. This will take few hours to complete, since the screw heads was damaged there was any other way to remove screws. . . Weak 3D Printing Parts . There could be 3D printing parts that are weak and break. No issues, just use the glue and put them back! . . Buck Converter Steps . If you have a connector different than the MUSHR videos, then you might need to connect as shows to configure the buck converter . . Push Button Install Tip . Use the threads instead of screws. The screws didnt fit well to the back of the push button . . Camera Install Screw Alternative . This screw is provided as a part of BUCK CONVERTER . . Lower Platform Imperfections . 3D Imperfections are OK . . Upper Platform Trick . Stick a tape to the nut and them remove it. This is useful to screws on the backside of the platform which might fall off. . . Final Door Trick . If you screw the final door, then you need to remove it again for charging the batteries (which is more often than you think). To solve the issue, use the VELCRO as shown . . Misc Hardware Pics .",

This is NOT a TUTORIAL rather a buffet of practical problems faced and solutions provided to overcome them easily. . . Scenarios . Monitor not booting up, after MUSHR image is installed. . Issue . When you install the stock image of JETSON NANO using BelenaEtcher, connect JETSON NANO using HDMI, NAno boots and you can see the Linux GUI. But, if you do the same exact same thing using MUSHR IMAGE, it does not show the GUI. Without the GUI, software config is almost impossible. Well, almost. There is a &quot;command line&quot; solution provided as well for all the geeks out there. . Solution 1 . USE DISPLAY PORT . Important: If you have a monitor that supports DISPLAY PORT, use it!! Instant solution. (Time saving : 3-4 days). You can buy the display port from the link below. . DISPLAY PORT to DISPLAY PORT cable | . If you only have HDMI port, read on . Solution 2 . USE COMMAND LINE . STEP 1: SSH . You need to LOGIN (using SSH). For SSH, you need WIFI, For WIFI you need to LOGIN. Get it! chicken-egg problem? Almost. There is one possible solution, Hard-wired USB connection . Connect the MICRO USB port of NANO to the USB PORT of your laptop (also known as HEADLESS LOGIN) | . HEADLESS LOGIN (on a Mac) . #Go to dev directory cd /dev #check for all things like tty and usb ls *tty*usb* tty.usbmodem146123 # result (yours might be slightly different) #use the screen command with the result of previous step + serial interface number screen tty.usbmodem146123 115200 # 115200 is the Jetson serial interface. &quot;screen&quot; is installed on a mac by default # (It will ask for SUDO login and password) . . ACTIVATE THE ROOT in JETSON NANO . Be aware that the root account is not active by default. You will need to do: . sudo passwd root . Then go ahead to set password. Use the root user using . su root . USE WPA_SUPPLICANT TO CONNECT . # CREATE a file at */etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf* vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf # PRESS &quot;I&quot; to start insert mode # Add this content to the file ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant update_config=1 # PRESS &quot;:wq&quot; to save and quit the editor # Then, run this command wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf wpa_cli -i wlan0 # This will present an interactive prompt (&gt;), which has tab completion and descriptions of completed commands. scan # Ok # &lt;3&gt;CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS scan_results # bssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid # 00:00:00:00:00:00 2462 -49 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS] MYSSID # 11:11:11:11:11:11 2437 -64 [WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS] ANOTHERSSID add_network # 0 set_network 0 ssid &quot;MYSSID&quot; set_network 0 psk &quot;passphrase&quot; enable_network 0 #&lt;2&gt;CTRL-EVENT-CONNECTED - Connection to 00:00:00:00:00:00 completed (reauth) [id=0 id_str=] save_config # OK quit . Check if the wireless device is up . ip link show wlan0 #Look for the word &quot;UP&quot; inside the brackets in the first line of the output. /sbin/iw wlan0 link # Connected to &lt;your network&gt;&gt; ping google.com # testing if it connects ifconfig #GET the IP. Needed to connect to SSH. Uff, finally! . **Connect to the JETSON NANO . Open a terminal window . ssh -X robot@IP_ADDRESS #enter your IP address (Notice -X) . STEP 2: GPARTED, BLUETOOTH, IP ADDRESS FIX . Before installing anything, there seems to be some sort of lock on the &quot;linux&quot; installer to donwload. For eg. . E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock – open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable) E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it? . Here is the fix : . sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend . GPARTED . sudo apt-get install gparted gparted # opens up the GUI as shown below. Now, follow instructions from the MUSHR site. . . . BLUETOOTH . hcitool dev . If the Bluetooth adapter is working and available, you should see its address listed (each address is unique): . Devices: hci0 38:##:##:##:##:## . bluetoothctl #opens up a bluetooth prompt agent on scan on # scan near by bluetooth devices. Start your PS4 controller scan off # Switch it off after getting the MAC ADDRESS of the wireless controller trust MAC_ADDRESS # trust, pair and connect pair MAC_ADDRRESS connect MAC_ADDRESS . . After connecting to the bluetooth, we should test it. . sudo apt-get install -y jstest-gtk # install the jstest package jstest-gtk #run this. It will open up GUI as follows . . IP ADDRESS FIX . ROS IP and MASTER URI will not be set to your IP automatically. USe this commands below in the local bashrc file so that it is set everytime you login (vs you typing these commands everytime) . export ROS_IP=&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt; export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://&lt;&lt;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS&gt;&gt;:11311 . . BLDC Tool . . Important: Now, this step can only be done when you finish the Hardware configuration since you need the VESC connected to JETSON NANO + MOTOR to test it properly. . cd &amp;&amp; ./bldc-tool/BLDC_Tool . Version Problem . If you have ordered Flipsky VESC, chances are that you will have 3.X firmware installed (The hardware version is 410/411/412, but the firmware version is different). . Warning: BLDC tool can only support 2.18 (and hence MUSHR car). This wil throw an SERIAL PORT ERROR and will NOT connect to BLDC TOOL GUI. BLDC is old tool and is replaced by VESC TOOL . Solution . Download the VESC TOOL from the website and it will let you connect easily. | It will ask you to install the latest software.DO NOT install latest. | Use &quot;custom&quot; firmware (follow this link). The custom firmware is nothing but the BLDC servoout.bin file that is installed via BLDC tool. (also available here) | Now, open the BLDC tool and hit &quot;connect&quot; and it will be successful. | Follow the instructions from the MUSHR Software Setup i.e load the sensorless xml config file and &quot;write&quot; it back to VESC | . Note: If VESC tool is a newer version of the BLDC tool, why is heck do we need BLDC tool? MUSHR parameters has been set to BLDC tool and works only when you use it. . Note: Everything spinning in the right direction?? In the BLDC tool, Push the &quot;top&quot; arrow key and the wheels should move forward, and vice versa, if it moves in the reverse direction, it means the &quot;wires&quot; from the VESC to the motor has been criss crossed. Reverse the wire connection and you should be good. See below for visual. I personally used VESC tool to check it. . References . wiki.archlinux | bbs.archlinux.org | linuxcommando | desertbot | .",

            "content": "Purpose . To build a low cost self driving car inspired from the paper MuSHR: A Low-Cost, Open-Source Robotic Racecar for Education and Research. They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. . Background . My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted MUSHR website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step. Additionally, they report in their website that its &quot;Classroom-tested&quot; which is what I wanted to hear. So i decided to jump-in with blind faith that it will be worth my time. . The Missing Manual . MUSHR team have excellent documentation which helps anyone understand and build a self driving car. But there is a saying . In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is&quot; . Over the next few sections, I will report all the issue I faced and my attemps to fix it. Someone of them are major issues and some minor, but nevertheless you need to overcome them in order to proceed. . Acquiring the parts . All the materials needed for the projects and outlined here It even provides links to various websites to order parts. . . Tip 1 : Order the 3D parts first . . Important: There are 3D printed parts needed to complete the assembly. Might add &quot;weeks&quot; to your project if taken lightly. Order the 3D parts here . Ordering the 3D printed parts is tricky. The local library will be cheap but will take weeks before they complete. On the other hand, there are industries who can finish in 2 days, but will charge ~400-500 bucks. After a lot of research I found 3DHUBS. They are fast (3-4 day shippng time) and cheaper than most of them I could find on the internet. . They need your offical/school email ID (not personal gmail/outlook) | Choose Standard PLA (FDM) This is the cheapest material. | DO NOT order racecar_cover_number, racecar_cover_text and racecar_cover_image It&#39;s not needed to build the assembly and will save you about $30-40. Moreover, 3dhubs will report these as errors which are tough to fix (not a good use of your time) . Important: By the way it will cost you around ~$175 | . Tip 2 : Order Tools and Accessories . Apart from ordering parts from https://mushr.io/hardware/build_instructions/ there are extra tools needed which are assumed to be present in every household. Make sure you order the following parts also. . Screw Driver Set (115 in 1 Magnetic Screwdriver) You need screw driver bits of various shapes and sizes to finish the project, so do not assume your 1/2 favorite screw driver will work in this case | Crimping tool | HandGun | Soldering Kit | HXT 4mm Bullet to Male T-Plug Connector | . Optional Tools . Important: Applicable to only MACBOOK and USBC-only windows laptop. Find similar products to suit your laptop configuration. . MEMORY CARD reader | . Tip 3 : Order REDCAT with Brushless Motor installed . In the instructions manual, there are 2 options for provided for the Redcat Racing Blackout. . Choose the one with BRUSHLESS MOTOR | DO NOT ORDER &quot;Sensorless Brushless Motor&quot; (saves $30) | . Tip 4 : Picking the right VESC . This is the order of recommendation. . Turnigy version (Recommended. No soldering required) . | Flipsky version (I ordered this due to &quot;out of stock&quot; on other items) . | MayTech version . | . Tip 5 : Misc Tips . Intel RealSense T265 is not needed for your first version of the car. You can add later if you choose to. | Solderless Wire Connector from the instructions is currently unavailable.
