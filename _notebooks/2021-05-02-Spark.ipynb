    "    - clean – the project is clean of all artifacts that came from previous compilations \n",

    "    - install – packaged archive is copied into local maven repository (could in your user's home directory under /.m2) \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **groupId** This element indicates the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project. The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization. For example org.apache.maven.plugins is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **artifactId** This element indicates the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project. The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. A typical artifact produced by Maven would have the form \n",
    "<artifactId>-<version>.<extension> (for example, myapp-1.0.jar).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **packaging** This element indicates the package type to be used by this artifact (e.g. JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.). This not only means if the artifact produced is JAR, WAR, or EAR but can also indicate a specific lifecycle to use as part of the build process. (The lifecycle is a topic we will deal with further on in the guide. For now, just keep in mind that the indicated packaging of a project can play a part in customizing the build lifecycle.) The default value for the packaging element is JAR so you do not have to specify this for most projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **version** This element indicates the version of the artifact generated by the project. Maven goes a long way to help you with version management and you will often see the SNAPSHOT designator in a version, which indicates that a project is in a state of development. We will discuss the use of snapshots and how they work further on in this guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **name** This element indicates the display name used for the project. This is often used in Maven's generated documentation.\n",
