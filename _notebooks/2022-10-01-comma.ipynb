    "\n",

    "# Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "Every self driving car (except TESLA) will tell you the reason why they want to develop autonomous cars is to make driving safer and humans are bad drivers. Humans crash cars! Humans are distracted!. Yes all of this is absolutely true! but for 1-5% of the population. the other 95% are good drivers and been doing so for the last 100 years!  So, there is nothing wrong with the system. We only need to is to make our commute better like less annoying (better GPS?), less fatigue (better cruise control?) and a good music system. What comma ai is focusing (and every other company should focus) is a reduction of fatigue and making driving chill! thats it. \n",
