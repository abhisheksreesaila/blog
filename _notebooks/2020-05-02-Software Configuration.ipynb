    "\n",
    "When you install the stock image of JETSON NANO using [BelenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher), connect JETSON NANO using HDMI, NAno boots and you can see the Linux GUI. But, if you do the same exact same thing using [MUSHR IMAGE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Xn63ZWA_e3DVxt_ajhzu-uKW0hUG4iX/view?usp=sharing), it does not show the GUI. without the GUI, software config is almost impossible (*well, I am not referring to LINUX gurus here, everything possible from a GUI is also possible with command line in LINUX*). In other words, we need the GUI working.\n",
