    "\n",
    "- RCU - Residual Conv Unit\n",
    "    -  Simplified version of the convolution unit in the original ResNet where the batch-normalization layers are removed\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Multi Resolution Fusion\n",
    "  - All path inputs are then fused into a high-resolution feature map by the multi-resolution fusion block.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chained Residual Pooling\n",
    "  - The proposed chained residual pooling aims to capture background context from a large\n",
    "    image region. It is able to efficiently pool features with multiple window sizes and fuse     them together using learnable weights. In particular, this component is built as a\n",
    "    chain of multiple pooling blocks, each consisting of one max-pooling layer and one   convolution layer. One pooling block takes the output of the previous pooling block as input. Therefore, the current pooling block is able to re-use the result from the previous pooling operation and thus access the features from a large region without using a large pooling window.\n",
