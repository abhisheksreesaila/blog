    "rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Here we need to visualize and track car's movements in your laptop computer. So you have to set the variables correctly so that CAR can send the messages to your computer and vice-versa.\n",

    "- **BALANCE CHARGE**  Charges both the cells inside the battery equally. Use this setting 99.99% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **STORAGE CHARGE**  Charges the cells in such a way so that you can store them for months (and hence the name). LIPOS if they are allowed to drain, will drain completely and not work this requiring them to jump start. \n",
