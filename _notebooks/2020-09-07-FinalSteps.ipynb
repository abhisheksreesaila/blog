    "\n",
    "rviz is a 3D visualizer for the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework. Here we need to visualize and track car's movements in your laptop computer. So you have to set the variables correctly so that CAR can send the messages to your computer and vice-versa.\n",

For this purpose there is an undocumented utility [CROP_MAP]('https://github.com/abhisheksreesaila/blog/blob/master/assets/softwares/crop_map') to crop the map, removing the blank spaces around the map.In my case, it reduced by 20x. \n",
