    "# Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a low cost self driving car inspired from the paper [MuSHR: A Low-Cost, Open-Source Robotic Racecar for Education and Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08031). They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed [Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. \n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted [MUSHR](https://mushr.io) website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP7qljzG3RU&list=PLU9BrzGX4PH2DHZzxOg2gEkLMXhpkS7fV), I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step. Additionally, they report in their website that its \"Classroom-tested\" which i wanted to hear. So i decided to jump-in with blind faith that it will be worth my time. \n",
