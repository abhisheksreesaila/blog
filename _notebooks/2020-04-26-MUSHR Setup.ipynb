    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a low cost self driving car inspired from the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08031. They have provided excellent documentation and steps necessary to build a autonomous car. I completed [Udacity Nano Degree on Self Driving](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) and understood the theory, but never really thought i could experience the joy and thrill of building my own CAR that can drive itself. \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "My background was in computer science and have no experience in electronics. So when i visted [MUSHR.IO] (https://mushr.io) website, I was intimidated. I felt this was meant to be for hackers and electronics geeks who understood coding and not the other way around. When I watched their videos, I was impressed that the team at MUSHR has explained it step-by-step. Additionally, they report in their website that its \"Classroom-tested\" which i wanted to hear. So i decided to jump-in with blind faith that it will be worth my time. \n",

    "## The missing manual\n",
    "\n",
    "MUSHR team have excellent documentation which helps anyone understand and build a self driving car. But there is a saying \n",
    "> \"In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice, there is\"\n",

    "Over the next few sections, I will report all the issue I faced and my attemps to fix it. Someone of them are major issue, some of them are super silly, but nevertheless you need to ovecome inorder to proceed. \n",
