    "If you take a cross section of the brain, its looks like interconnected wires. If you model your outside world, like the internal, then its \"natural\" and promotes better creation of new ideas. If your force yourself to be \"neat\" then there is friction or what is commonly known as the \"writers block\".\n",
    "\n",
    "While traditional list-based note taking works, mind map takes this to the next level by adding color, images and free flow format that is absent in lists. This has helped me refer the material easily since i can glance all-at-once quickly, or go to a section without hunting and pecking. Colors and images aids recall and presents the materials in a fun and entertaining way and makes the whole note-taking experience \"playful\" rather than work.\n",
