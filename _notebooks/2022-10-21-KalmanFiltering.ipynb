    "\n",
    "- **PREDICTION** - Predict the next state of the object. \n",
    "- **MEASUREMENT** - Measure the current state of the object.\n",
    "- **CONFIDENCE** - How good (or bad) the PREDICTED or MEASUREMENT values\n",

    "# Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman filter (or variants) have the following intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CURRENT STATE**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose current time is 3:00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "**PREDICTION over MEASUREMENT**\n",
    "\n",
    "- After few mins, we look at the watch again and we PREDICT its 3:04pm, but its shows 3:55pm!! \n",
    "- We know the MEASUREMENT is wrong and  have every reason to believe the PREDICTION is more acccurate and set the watch to be 3:04pm. Our CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT is shaken, we believe it is so noisy to show 3:55pm \n",
    "\n",
    "**MEASUREMENT over PREDICTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, if the measurement shows 3:05 pm, we have greater confidence that MEASUREMENT is correct, since its more or less in line with our expectations and since its actually measured, thats should be more accurate. Here we trust or more CONFIDENCE in the MEASUREMENT. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "If measurement comes with a very little error, then we are closing in on the true value.  $E_{mea}$ is low, then KG is high (close to 1).\n",
    "Then (1-KG) is very low. that means its drops the value of $E_{est_{t-1}} significantly, hence moving towards the \"true\" value.  Intuitively it makes sense, measurements are good, the system should converge to a good estimate.  Note that, in the real world, no matter how good the measurement is there is always noise, it will never be perfect. \n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite is also true. Measurements are unstable, then $E_{mea}$ is large, KG is low, 1-KG is high (or close to 1). Then we can trust the measurements coming, so we do not move the needle as much and try to keep the value close to the current error in estimate value as much as possible.  \n",
