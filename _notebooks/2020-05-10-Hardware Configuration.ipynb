    "During the installation of the SERVO MOTOR, You need to remove the hex screws. BUT the hex screws are tough to remove and might end up messing up the screw head. This damage can be permananent and will prevent from removing the existing SERVO MOTOR!  In other words, the screws will SCREW you! and it did in my case.  See below.  To counter that, I had to remove the TOP parts (melt them, crack them etc.) and naturally the screws will open up at the bottom. This will take few hours to complete, since the screw heads was damaged there was any other way to remove screws. \n",
